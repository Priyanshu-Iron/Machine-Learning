# 📸 OpenCV - Computer Vision & Image Processing

Welcome to my OpenCV journey! 🚀 I'm learning OpenCV from **OpenCV University** 🎓 to explore the world of **computer vision, image processing, and AI**.

## 🔍 What is OpenCV?
**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)** is a powerful open-source library for real-time image processing and computer vision applications.

## 📚 Learning Path
Here’s what I’m exploring in OpenCV:
- ✅ **Image Processing** 🎨 (filters, transformations, edge detection)
- ✅ **Video Processing** 🎥 (capturing, motion detection)
- ✅ **Object Detection & Tracking** 🎯 (face detection, contours, bounding boxes)
- ✅ **Deep Learning Integration** 🤖 (using models like YOLO, TensorFlow, PyTorch)

## 🛠️ Installation
You can install OpenCV using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
For extra features:
```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

## 🚀 My Projects
🛠️ **Coming Soon...** Stay tuned for exciting projects! 🎨
