# ðŸ“‚ My Data Science & Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to my repository! ðŸŒŸ This is a **learning repository**, where I explore various concepts related to **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision**. Below is a brief overview of each folder and its contents.

## ðŸ“š Project Structure

- **Game of Thrones Project** ðŸ‘‘
  - Analyzing data from the Game of Thrones series.
  - Visualizations, character relationships, and predictions.

- **NumPy** ðŸ“ˆ
  - Basics of NumPy for numerical computing.
  - Array operations, indexing, and mathematical functions.

- **OpenCV** ðŸ“¸
  - Learning and implementing OpenCV for computer vision.
  - Image processing, object detection, and video analysis.

- **Pandas Basic** ðŸ“‘
  - Introduction to Pandas for data manipulation.
  - DataFrames, Series, and basic data analysis.

- **Placement Prediction Model** ðŸ’¼
  - A machine learning model to predict student placement outcomes.
  - Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸŽ‰ Contributions & Future Work
- Exploring deep learning integration with OpenCV.
- Expanding the placement prediction model with more features.
- Enhancing the Game of Thrones analysis with sentiment analysis.

Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
